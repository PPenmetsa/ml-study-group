# Intro
This repo is designed to help standardize some useful tools for running Jupyter notebooks
and fiddling around with hands-on data projects to practice and understand ML. It includes the proper configuration to use cmake and docker to have a turnkey solution to launch a notebook very similarly to the Kaggle kernels experience right on your local machine.

# Prerequisites
You need to have docker and cmake installed, that's it!

Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/
Make: You probably already have this tool, but you can see here if you really don't have it: https://cmake.org/download/
